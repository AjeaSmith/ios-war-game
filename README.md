# War Game - iOS
## Learning Objectives

- Building `user interfaces` either through code or inspector panel
- `Layout Containers` to organize views (`VStack`, `ZStack`, `HStack`, etc.)
- `Functions` to run specific code
- using `Structures` to declare views and business logic.
- Creating instances of models using either `classes` or `structs`
- Creating `buttons` that trigger actions
- Using `@State` wrapper property within views, to modify values within a struct. This is not allowed by default. 
- `if statements` that control your logic and what happens next
